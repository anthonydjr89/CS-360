# CS-360

The app I developed was designed to meet all the project requirements by allowing users to log in, create accounts, and manage event data through a simple and user-friendly interface. It was created to help users easily keep track of events and receive SMS reminders, addressing the need for basic event organization and alerting. To support these user needs, I created screens for login, registration, viewing events in a grid layout, and adding, editing, and deleting events. The UI was kept simple, easy to navigate, and focused on making important actions simple to find and use, which made it successful for users who are not experienced with apps. During coding, I broke down the work into small parts, tested each feature as I built it, and used simple naming conventions and comments to stay organized. I also made sure to use strategies like modular coding and regular testing, which can be applied to future projects to stay on track and prevent bugs. To test the app, I used the Android Emulator after adding each new function, checking both normal and edge cases like permission denial for SMS. This testing helped find errors early and made sure the app would work even if users did not allow SMS permissions. Throughout the project, I faced a few challenges, such as making sure the app stayed functional when SMS permissions were denied, but I overcame them by  handling the permission results and making sure the app logic continued correctly. I believe I was successful in demonstrating my skills with the database management part, where users could fully create, read, update, and delete event data and see it displayed correctly in a grid, with the database staying persistent after closing the app.
